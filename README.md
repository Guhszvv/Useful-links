# Useful Links

Useful Links is a simple and straightforward website hosted on GitHub Pages that brings together a curated collection of useful online tools. The goal of the project is to make it easy to access reliable and practical websites for a variety of everyday needs, such as:

🔗 **File downloads:** tools to download videos, music, documents, and other types of content from the internet.

🖼️ **Image tools:** online utilities to resize, convert, compress, or edit images.

📁 **File management:** PDF tools, converters, compressors, viewers, and editors for various file types.

🤖 **AI tools:** quick access to artificial intelligence services for productivity, content creation, and more.

The idea is to provide a digital toolbox that’s always available, with categorized pages and working, hand-picked links.
